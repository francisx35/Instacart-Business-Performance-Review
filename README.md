Instacart Business Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI & SQL)

This project presents a data-driven business review of Instacart using Power BI and SQL. It highlights operational insights, sales performance, and opportunities for strategic improvements based on historical customer order data.

🛠️ Tools Used

PostgreSQL (SQL) – for querying, data transformation, and business logic implementation
Power BI – for data modeling, KPI tracking, and dashboard creation
DAX – for dynamic calculations, segmentation, and business metrics

🎯 Project Objectives

Visualise Instacart’s key performance indicators (KPIs)
Identify high-demand aisles with low profitability
Highlight best and worst performing products
Analyse peak ordering times to optimize staffing
Understand sales trends to inform inventory and marketing planning

📊 Key Findings

✅ KPIs Summary
Total Orders: 1,049,000
Total Customers: 69,000
Total Revenue: $158 million
Average Order Value: $151

📌 High-Demand, Low-Profitability Aisles
Aisles like Oral Hygiene, Packaged Vegetables, and Spices Seasonings had high demand but low profit per unit
These aisles represent potential for supplier renegotiation or product mix revision

🌟 Best and Worst Selling Products
Top Sellers: Green tea with ginseng, Tender white meat chicken
Underperformers: Low-volume niche products — flagged for review or bundling

🕒 Peak Ordering Hours
Peak time: 9 AM – 5 PM
Opportunity to increase staffing during high-volume hours and reduce during late-night

📈 Sales Trends
Revenue peaks in January and March
Dips in off-peak months indicate potential for seasonal campaigns

✅ Recommendations

Review supplier agreements for low-margin aisles
Promote top-selling products with bundles or featured listings
Align staffing schedules with peak operational hours
Use sales trend analysis for proactive inventory planning
Run clearance promotions during low-demand months
